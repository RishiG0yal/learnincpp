# 🚀 Learning C++ Journey

Welcome to my C++ learning repository! This is where I practice and document my progress in mastering C++ programming.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This repository contains practical C++ programs that demonstrate various programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced topics including file handling, data structures, and menu-driven applications.

## 🗂️ Project Files

| File | Description | Concepts Covered |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `movieseatbooking.cpp` | Interactive movie theater seat booking system with file persistence | 2D arrays, file I/O, input validation, menu systems, string manipulation |
| `attendance_marking.cpp` | Student attendance management system with teacher/student roles | Structures, file handling, arrays, password authentication, data persistence |

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or Visual Studio)
- Terminal/Command prompt

### Compilation & Execution
```bash
# Compile
g++ filename.cpp -o program_name

# Run
./program_name
```

### Example
```bash
g++ movieseatbooking.cpp -o booking
./booking
```

## 📖 Learning Path

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned

- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding int, char, string, bool
- **Control Flow**: if-else, switch, loops (for, while)
- **Arrays**: Single and multi-dimensional arrays for seat mapping
- **Functions**: Creating reusable code blocks with input validation
- **Structures**: Organizing related data (Student, Attendance records)
- **File I/O**: Persistent data storage using ifstream/ofstream
- **String Processing**: Parsing seat inputs (e.g., "A5" → row 0, col 4)
- **Menu Systems**: Interactive user interfaces with role-based access

## 🎯 Project Features

### Movie Seat Booking System
- 5x10 seat grid visualization
- Real-time seat availability display
- Multiple seat booking in one transaction
- Seat cancellation functionality
- Data persistence across program runs
- Input validation for seat selection

### Attendance Management System
- Role-based access (Teacher/Student)
- Password-protected teacher functions
- Student registration and management
- Date-wise attendance tracking
- Individual attendance viewing
- Complete attendance records display
- File-based data storage

## 📝 Notes for Fellow Learners

- Start with simple programs and gradually increase complexity
- Practice coding daily, even if it's just 30 minutes
- Don't just copy code - understand what each line does
- Debug your own code to learn problem-solving
- Focus on user experience and input validation
- Learn file handling early - it makes programs more practical
