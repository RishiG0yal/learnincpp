# 🚀 Learning C++ Journey

Welcome to my C++ learning repository! This is where I practice and document my progress in mastering C++ programming.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

This repository contains practical C++ programs that demonstrate various programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced topics.

## 🗂️ Project Files

| File | Description | Concepts Covered |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `movieseatbooking.cpp` | Movie theater seat booking system | Arrays, loops, user input, conditionals |

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, or Visual Studio)
- Terminal/Command prompt

### Compilation & Execution
```bash
# Compile
g++ filename.cpp -o program_name

# Run
./program_name
```

### Example
```bash
g++ movieseatbooking.cpp -o booking
./booking
```

## 📖 Learning Path

### ✅ Completed Topics
- [x] Basic I/O operations
- [x] Arrays and loops
- [x] Conditional statements
- [x] Functions

### 🎯 Currently Learning
- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)
- [ ] Pointers and Memory Management
- [ ] STL (Standard Template Library)

### 🔮 Future Topics
- [ ] Data Structures (Stack, Queue, Linked Lists)
- [ ] Algorithms (Sorting, Searching)
- [ ] File Handling
- [ ] Exception Handling

## 💡 Key Concepts Learned

- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding int, char, string, bool
- **Control Flow**: if-else, switch, loops (for, while)
- **Arrays**: Single and multi-dimensional arrays
- **Functions**: Creating reusable code blocks

## 📝 Notes for Fellow Learners

- Start with simple programs and gradually increase complexity
- Practice coding daily, even if it's just 30 minutes
- Don't just copy code - understand what each line does
- Debug your own code to learn problem-solving
